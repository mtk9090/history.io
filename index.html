	<p style="font-size:2rem; text-shadow: -1px 0 black, 0 1px black, 1px 0 black, 0 -1px black;"><em>There was once a farmer and his wife. She had been married before, her first husband had died, and now she was married again. They lived on a remote farm in the west of England, and what a pair of fools they were! Which of them was the most foolish? Listen to the story and decide for yourself. 
	  Jack looked up at the pale blue sky, and he said, “I came from Heaven.” “My goodness!”, she said. “Did you see my husband there?” (The farmer’s wife was talking about her first husband, the man who had died). “Oh yes, I got to know him well when I was staying in Heaven,” said Jack. “And how is he doing?”, asked the woman. “He is fine,” replied the old soldier.
	  “He works hard sewing and mending clothes for the saints and angels, but even so, he sometimes doesn’t have enough money to eat.” “And did he send me a message?”, she asked. “Yes, he did! That is why I’ve come here. He asked me to bring back some money for him, so that he can spend his days in paradise more comfortably.” On hearing this, the poor woman’s heart almost broke with pity.
	  I’ll give him anything he wants! He’s a good man, God bless him,” she said. Then she went to the chimney where the couple’s savings were kept hidden. She took out two pieces of gold and five pieces of silver, which in those days was a lot of money. She handed everything over to the old soldier and told him to hurry up and give it to her first husband. “I will,” Jack told the woman, “as soon as I return to Heaven.”
	  When the farmer came back, his wife told him all about how a messenger had come from Heaven. She said that the man asked for money for her first husband, who was living and working in Heaven, but who was poor. “You are a foolish woman!” shouted the farmer. “How could you believe such a silly story?” “Well, you are even more foolish,” said the woman, “because you showed me where the money was hidden.” The husband did not agree with what she said, but he did not stay to argue. He hurried off on his horse to try to find the old soldier before he got too far away
	  Jack Hannaford heard the sound of the horse behind him. He knew that the farmer was coming for him and for the money. Quickly, he came up with a plan. He knelt by the side of the road, covered his eyes with one hand, and pointed up to the sky with the other. The farmer soon reached him and asked: “What are you doing here by the side of the road? Why are you protecting your eyes and pointing up to the sky?”“It is amazing! It is God’s work!” shouted the man. “I see a wonderful thing!” “What kind of wonderful thing?” asked the farmer. “A man is walking straight up to Heaven on a rainbow, just as if it were a road.
	  The farmer looked at the sky, but he could not see the amazing rainbow or the man walking on it. “Here,” said the soldier, “kneel down by the side of the road and look up at the sky like I’m doing.” “I will if you’ll hold my horse,” said the farmer, and he jumped down from his horse. As soon as the farmer knelt down, Jack Hannaford jumped onto the horse and escaped! Now, who do you think was more foolish, the farmer or his wife?</em>

	</div>

	<p style="font-size:2rem; text-shadow: -1px 0 black, 0 1px black, 1px 0 black, 0 -1px black;"><em>
	  In the Far East there was a Great King who had no work to do. Every day, and 
all day long, he sat on soft cushions and listened to stories. And no matter 
what the story was about, he never grew tired of hearing it, even though 
many of the stories took hours to complete. “There is only one fault with your 
story,” he often said, “it is too short.” All the storytellers in the world were 
invited to his palace; and some of them told stories that were very long 
indeed.
But The King was always sad when the story ended.At last he sent a message 
to every city and town, offering a prize to any one able to tell him an endless 
tale. He said: “To the man that will tell me a story which lasts forever, I will 
give my daughter as his wife; and I will make him my heir, and he shall be king 
after me.” But this challenge wasn’t quite what it seemed. The King added a 
strict condition. “If any man tries to tell such a story and fails, then his head 
will be cut off.”
The King's daughter was very beautiful, and many young men in The
Kingdom were willing to do anything to win her. But none of them wanted to
lose his head, and so only a few tried for the prize. One young man invented
a story that lasted three months; but after that, he could think of nothing
more. His fate was a warning to others, and it was a long time before another
storyteller was daring enough to take the King's challenge.
One day a Stranger from the South came to The Palace. “Great king,” he said,
“is it true that you offer a prize to the man who can tell a story that has no
end?” “It is true,” said The King. “And will this man have your daughter for his
wife, and will he be your heir?” “Yes, if he succeeds,” said The King, “but if he
fails, he will lose his head.” “Very well, then,” said the Stranger. “I have a
pleasant story about locusts.” “Tell it,” said The King. “I will listen to you.”
The storyteller began his story. “Once upon a time a certain king seized all
the corn in his country, and stored it in a strong granary, but a swarm of
locusts came over the land and saw where the grain was stored. After
searching for many days, the locusts found a small crack on the east side of
the granary, but the opening was just large enough for one locust at a time to
pass through. So, one locust went in and carried away a grain of corn; then
another locust went in and carried away a grain of corn; then another locust
went in and carried away a grain of corn.”

Day after day, week after week, the Stranger kept on saying, “Then another
locust went in and carried away a grain of corn.” A month passed. A year
passed. After two years, The King asked, “How much longer will the locusts
be going in and carrying away corn?” “Oh, King!" said the Stranger, “the
locusts have only cleared a few inches, and there are thousands of inches in
the granary."
“Man, man!" cried The King, “You will drive me mad. I can listen to it no
longer. Take my daughter, be my heir, and rule my Kingdom, but do not let
me hear another word about those incessant locusts!" So, the Stranger
married The King's daughter and lived happily in the land for many years;
however, his father-in-law, The King, did not care to listen to any more
stories.

	</div>

	<p style="font-size:2rem; text-shadow: -1px 0 black, 0 1px black, 1px 0 black, 0 -1px black;"><em>Once upon a time there lived a poor widow and her son Jack. One day, 
Jack’s mother told him to sell their only cow. Jack went to the market 
and on the way he met a man who wanted to buy his cow. Jack asked, 
"What will you give me in return for my cow?" The man answered, "I will 
give you five magic beans!" Jack took the magic beans and gave the man 
the cow. But when he reached home, Jack’s mother was very angry. She 
said, "You fool! He took away your cow and gave you some beans!" She 
threw the beans out of the window.

Jack was very sad and went to sleep without dinner. The next day, when
Jack woke up in the morning and looked out of the window, he saw that
a huge beanstalk had grown from his magic beans! He climbed up the
beanstalk and reached a kingdom in the sky. There lived a giant and his
wife. Jack went inside the house and found the giant’s wife in the
kitchen. Jack said, "Could you please give me something to eat? I am so
hungry!" The kind wife gave him bread and some milk. While he was
eating, the giant came home.

The giant was very big and looked very fearsome. Jack was terrified and
went and hid inside. The giant cried, “Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of
a boy. Dead or alive, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!”, but the wife
said, “There is no boy in here!” So, the giant ate his food and then went
to his room. He took out his sacks of gold coins, counted them and kept
them aside. Then he went to sleep. In the night, Jack crept out of his
hiding place, took one sack of gold coins and climbed down the
beanstalk.

At home, he gave the coins to his mother. His mother was very happy
and they lived well for sometime. A few days later, Jack once again
climbed the beanstalk and went to the giant’s house. Jack asked the
giant’s wife for food, but while he was eating the giant returned. Jack
then hid under the bed. The giant cried, "Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood
of an boy. Dead or alive, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!" The wife
again said, "There is no boy in here!" The giant ate his food and went to
his room. There, he took out a hen. He shouted, "Lay!" and the hen laid
a golden egg.

When the giant fell asleep, Jack took the hen and climbed down the
beanstalk. Jack’s mother was very happy with him. After some days,
Jack once again climbed the beanstalk and went to the giant’s castle.
For the third time, Jack met the giant’s wife and asked for some food.
Once again, the giant’s wife gave him bread and milk. But while Jack was
eating, the giant came home. "Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an boy.
Dead or alive, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!" cried the giant.
"Don’t be silly! There is no boy in here!" said his wife.

The giant had a magical harp that could play beautiful songs. While the
giant slept, Jack took the harp and was about to leave. Suddenly, the
magic harp cried, "Help master! A boy is stealing me!" The giant woke
up and saw Jack with the harp. Furious, he ran after Jack. But Jack was
too fast for him. He ran down the beanstalk and reached home. The
giant followed him down. Jack quickly ran inside his house and fetched
an axe. He began to chop the beanstalk. The giant fell and died. Jack and
his mother were now very rich and they lived happily ever after.

The underground paths housing the Minotaur beneath the isle of Crete 
were created by the dangerous and intelligent mind of Daedalus, an 
artist of design and construction. Daedalus was so brilliant that King 
Minos of Crete kept him as a prisoner. Daedalus lived with his son Icarus 
in a tower of the palace, and King Minos made him build tremendous 
weapons of war. Although Daedalus and Icarus had a very comfortable 
life in the tower of the palace, the father wished to return home to 
Athens. His son hardly remembered Athens, but he dreamed of running 
and playing in the open.

Daedalus looked at the waves of the Mediterranean Sea, and realized
that even if they could manage to escape from the tower and find a little
boat, they wouldn’t get very far before they were caught by one of the
ships of King Minos’ navy.He thought for a long time about the best way
to escape and finally, he came up with a plan. He told King Minos that he
needed feathers and wax for a new project. After Daedalus received the
feathers, he took them to the roof of the tower, and placed the feathers
into four lines. He organized the feathers from shortest to longest until
the feathers formed gentle half-moon shapes. Then, Daedalus stuck the
feathers together with string in the middle and wax at the base.

While Daedalus worked, Icarus played with the wax, making it flat
between his fingers, and he chased feathers that floated on the wind.
Daedalus showed Icarus how he had made the feathers into two pair of
wings. He put the larger pair onto his arms, and began to quickly move
them up and down until his feet took off from the floor, and he seemed
to stand in the sky. Icarus laughed and could not wait to try out the
smaller pair of wings.

Over the next few days, father and son both exercised the wings until
little Icarus was almost as good at flying as his father. Then one morning
Daedalus said: now son, we are ready to leave this island for good. We
shall fly home to Athens. Flying is beautiful, but it can be very
dangerous. Listen to my instructions and be sure to obey them
perfectly. At all times, follow me. Do not take a different flight path, or
you will soon be lost.

Do not fly too low or your wings will get wet from the waves, become
too heavy, and drown you. Nor should you fly too high, or the sun will
melt the wax, and your wings will fall apart. Have you understood all
that I have said? Little Icarus nodded his understanding. Then Daedalus
took his son to the highest walls of the tower and jumped into the sky,
flapping his wings. Icarus followed soon after. If a fisherman had looked
up just then, he would have thought that he saw two Ancient Spirits
with the arms of birds.

Over the seas, they moved through the sky, and at first Icarus felt afraid,
for he had never gone very far in his practice flights, but soon he found
that flying was the most fun you could ever have. He began to follow the
sea birds, dancing up and down above the ocean. His father turned
around and called, "Icarus, take care!", and for a while Icarus flew
carefully, like his father. But then his wings caught a warm air current,
and he found that he could move easily above and beyond with little
effort. This was the life!

He was flying so high that the ships down below looked like tiny insects.
His father called up to him, "Icarus, remember what I told you. Come
down right now!" Icarus could not hear him, however, and his father
could not reach him. Icarus was far too close to the sun, and soon the
wax that held the feathers together began to melt. Gradually his wings
began to lose their shape, and some of the feathers even fell off. Icarus
quickly moved his arms with worry and frenzy, but it was too late. He
had lost the power of flight, and down he fell with force into the sea.

	</div>

	<p style="font-size:2rem; text-shadow: -1px 0 black, 0 1px black, 1px 0 black, 0 -1px black;"><em>
in the old italian town of atri,the king bought a fine, large bell and hung 
it in the marketplace tower. a long rope that reached the ground was 
attached to the bell. the smallest child could ring the bell by pulling the 
rope. "it shall be the bell of justice," said the king. the bell gave the 
people of atri cause for a great holiday. everyone came to the 
marketplace to admire the bell of justice."perhaps the king will ring it," 
said the people, waiting to see what the king would do.

but the king did not ring the bell; he stopped and raised his hand. "my 
people", he said, "this bell is yours, but you must never use it except in 
times of need. when it rings, the judges shall come together at once,
hear the case, and give justice. rich and poor, young and old, it doesn't 
matter, all will be judged equally." many times, through the years, the 
bell in the marketplace called the judges. many troubles were 
corrected, and criminals answered for their crimes.

as time passed,the thick rope grew so thin and shortthat only a tall man
could reach it. "this will never do," said the judges one day. "what if a
child should find himself in trouble?" the judges gave orders that a new
rope should be hung down to the ground. but no lengthy rope could be
found in all of atri. they sent across the mountains for one, but it would
be weeks before it arrived. what if some great trouble should happen
before it came?

"let me fix it for you," said a man nearby. he ran into his garden and
came back with a strong vine. "this will do for a rope," he said, climbing
the bell tower to tie the vine to the bell. the vine easily reached the
ground. "yes," said the judges, "that will do." on the hills above the
village, there lived a man who had once been a knight, visiting foreign
lands and waging battles. his companion through all that time was his
loyal horse.

as the knight grew older, he sought only gold. he sold all that he had,
except his loyal horse. day after day, he sat in his little house among
his moneybags and planned how he might get more gold. day after day,
the loyal horse stood outside the knight's house, starving and teeth

chattering from the cold. "what is the use of keeping an old horse that
can’t work?" the mean old knight said to himself one morning. "i will
turn him out to fend for himself. if he dies of starvation, good riddance."

so, the brave, old horse was turned out among the rocks on the empty
hills. he limped weakly, nibbling at rare blades of grass. one hot
afternoon, the loyal horse happened to walk into the deserted
marketplace, and he saw the long plant rope that hung from the bell of
justice. the leaves upon it were still fresh and green. what a satisfying
dinner they would be for a starving horse! he stretched his thin neck,
tugging at a delicious leaf, and the great bell above him began to ring,
which all the people in atri heard.


the bell seemed to say, "someone has done me wrong! oh, come and 
judge my case!" the judges donned their official robes and went 
through the marketplace. when they passed through the gate,they saw 
the old horse eating the plant. "ha!" cried one, "it is the mean old 
knight’s loyal horse. everybody knows the knight mistreats him. he 
shall have justice!" said another citizen.

meanwhile, a crowd came into the marketplace, eager to hear a trial. the
loyal horse left them awestruck. all the citizens could testify to how they
saw the old knight neglecting his loyal horse and counting his bags of gold
instead. "go bring the old knight before us," said the judges. when the
knight came, the judges gave their judgment. "this loyal horse has served
you well for many years," they said. "he has saved you from danger and
helped you become wealthy; therefore, we order that one half of all your gold
be set aside for your loyal horse. with the money, we can buy a green field
for your loyal horse to graze in and a warm stable to comfort him in his old
age." the mean old knight hung his head, angry to have lost his gold, but the
people shouted with joy. the loyal horse was led to his new stable and had
a dinner fit for a brave and loyal horse.

	</div>

	<p style="font-size:2rem; text-shadow: -1px 0 black, 0 1px black, 1px 0 black, 0 -1px black;"><em>
Once upon a time, there were three bears, who lived in a house of their own 
deep in a forest. One of them was a Little Bear, one a Medium-sized Bear, and 
one a Big Bear. They had each a bowl for their porridge: a small bowl, a 
medium-sized bowl, and a great bowl. Also, they had each a chair to sit in: a 
small chair, a medium-sized chair, and a big chair. And they also had each a 
bed to sleep in: a small bed, a medium-sized bed, and a big bed. One day, after 
they carefully and neatly had made their beds and cooked porridge for 
breakfast, they took a walk in the woods while the porridge cooled in their 
bowls, so they wouldn’t burn their mouths.

They were polite, well-behaved bears. While they were away, a girl called
Goldilocks (she had long, wavy blonde hair) passed by the house and peeped
in the keyhole, for she was not at all a polite, well-behaved little girl. Seeing
nobody home, she lifted the door’s latch. The door was not locked because
the three bears did nobody any harm and never suspected anybody would
harm them. Goldilocks was pleased when she saw the porridge on the table.

If she had been a good little girl, she would have waited for the three bears to
come home, and perhaps they would’ve shared their breakfast.
Unfortunately, Goldilocks was insolent and rude, so she set about helping
herself. First she tasted the porridge of the Big Bear, and that was too hot.
Medium-sized bear’s porridge was too cold. But Little Bear’s porridge was
just right. She liked it so much that she ate it all up! After Goldilocks finished
breakfast, she sat down in the chair of the Big Bear, but it was too hard for
her. Medium-sized Bear’s chair was too soft. But Little Bear’s chair was just
right.

She sat in Little Bear’s small chair so long that the bottom of the chair came
out and she fell to the ground, which made her very cross. Determined to
rest, Goldilocks went upstairs into the bedchamber. First, she tried to lay on
the big bed, but it was too high. Then, she tried to lay on the medium-sized
bed, but it was too low. Finally, she tried the Little Bear’s bed, and it was just
right. She covered herself up comfortably and fell asleep. By this time, the
three bears thought their porridge would be cool enough for them to eat, so
they came home for breakfast.

Careless Goldilocks had left the spoon of the Big Bear standing in his
porridge. "Somebody has been at my porridge!" said the Big Bear. Then the
Medium-sized Bear also saw her spoon stuck in the middle of her porridge.

"Somebody has been at my porridge!" said the Medium-sized Bear. When
Little Bear looked at his bowl, there was his spoon, but the porridge was all
gone. "Somebody has been at my porridge and has eaten it all up!" The three
bears, knowing that someone had entered their house, began to look for the
intruder. They checked their chairs.

"Somebody has been sitting in my chair!" said both the Big Bear and the
Medium-sized Bear. "Somebody has been sitting in my chair, and has broken
the bottom of it!" said the Little Bear. Then, the three bears went upstairs
into their bedchamber, where Goldilocks had left the carefully made beds a
mess. "Somebody has been lying in my bed!" said the Big Bear. "Somebody
has been lying in my bed!" said the Medium-sized Bear. When Little Bear
looked at his bed, there was Goldilocks's yellow head on the pillow!
"Somebody has been lying in my bed — and she’s still here!"

In Goldilocks’ sleep, the great, gruff voice of the Big Bear sounded like no
more than the roaring wind. Medium-sized Bear's voice sounded like a little
bird chirping. But Little Bear’s voice was so sharp and shrill that she woke up
immediately. When Goldilocks saw the three bears on one side of the bed,
she tumbled herself off the other side of the bed, ran to the window, and
jumped.No one can say whether she ran into the deep forest and was lost or
found her way home and got whipped for being a bad girl. The three bears
never heard about her again and they lived happily ever after.

Long ago in Italy, there lived a child named Antonio Canova. His father had 
died, so Antonio lived with his grandfather, a poor stonecutter. Antonio was 
too small to work, but he loved to go with his grandfather to the stone-yard. 
While the old man cut the large, unwieldy blocks of stone, the boy played 
among the chips, sculpting little figures from soft clay or smaller rocks. 
Antonio’s skill surprised his grandfather. "The boy will be a sculptor some 
day," he said.

Every night when they got home, Antonio's grandmother would say, "What
have you been doing today, my little sculptor?" She would take him upon her
lap and tell him stories that filled his mind with pictures of beautiful things.
The next day, he would try to make some of those pictures in stone or clay. A
rich man named The Count also lived in the same town. Sometimes The
Count threw grand dinners for his wealthy friends from other towns.
Antonio's grandfather would go to The Count's house to help with the
kitchen work. He was a fine cook as he was a stonecutter.

One day, Antonio went with his grandfather to The Count's estate. The boy
could not cook or wait on the grand table, but he could help clean up. As
workers set the grand table, there was a crash in the dining room. A man, pale
and afraid, came quickly into the kitchen holding stone fragments. "What
should I do?" he cried. "I broke the centerpiece statue. The grand table will
look bare without it, and The Count will be angry." The staff trembled. Was
the dinner going to be a failure? Everything depended on having the grand
table perfectly set.

All of the staff asked, "What should we do?" Little Antonio approached the
terrified man who broke the centerpiece. "If you had another statue, could
you set the grand table perfectly?" "Certainly," said the man,"if it were the
right length and height." "Perhaps I can make something that will work," said
Antonio. The man laughed. "Impossible! Who are you, talking about making
statues on an hour's notice?" "I am Antonio Canova.""Let the boy try and see
what he can do," said the grandfather. The staff agreed. And so, since nothing
else could be done, the man allowed Antonio to try.

In the kitchen, a 200-pound piece of butter sat waiting to be appropriately
prepared. It had just arrived, fresh from the milk farm on the mountain. With
a kitchen knife in his hand, Antonio shaped this butter. He quickly created
the shape of a proud lion, and all at the staff came closer to see it. "How

beautiful!" they cried. "It’s much better than the broken statue." When it was
finished, the man carried the statue to its place. "The grand table will be more
beautiful than I ever hoped to make it!"

When The Count and his friends came to dinner, the first thing they saw was
the yellow lion on the grand table. "What a beautiful work of art!" they cried.
"Nobody but a great artist could ever create such a figure! Who made it?"
"Truly, my friends," The Count said, "this is as much of a surprise to me as to
you." The Count then called his head staff member and asked where he had
found this wonderful statue. "It was made only an hour ago by a little boy in
the kitchen," said the man.

This information made The Count's friends wonder more, so The Count
called the boy into the room. "My boy," he said, "you have done a piece of
work of which the greatest artists would be proud. What is your name, and
who is your teacher?" "My name is Antonio Canova, and I have had no
teacher but my grandfather, the stonecutter." All the guests came to stand
around Antonio. There were famous artists among them, and they knew that
the boy was a prodigy. When they sat down at the grand table, nothing
pleased them more than talking to Antonio, and the dinner became a party in
his honor. The very next day, The Count sent for Antonio to live with him. The
best artists in the land taught him to sculpt, and he learned how to carve in
marble. In a few years, Antonio Canova became known as one of the greatest
sculptors in the world.

I used to sneak into a house through a small crack to get supper sometimes. 
I'm a mouse, so I can fit through the teeniest entrances. Unfortunately, the 
house and its inhabitants weren't doing very well. Every time I visited, there 
were fewer crumbs. Additionally, the dangers hardly made it worthwhile. 
They had a cat who was getting skinnier, so I should have known that she 
would be on the lookout for a tasty morsel like me. Though my nose does 
twitch, I'm not nosey, but one night I could not help overhearing an 
argument.

"It's all your fault we're starving," said a distressed woman. "You shouldn't 
have sold my mother's ring behind my back. All you got for it was an old, lame 
horse!" "What's the ring got to do with it?" asked the man. "As I told you, the 
person who wears that ring will never go hungry." "I don't believe in magic 
and nonsense," replied the man. "That's why you are so thin and your 
trousers keep falling down." The conversation was so interesting that I hung 
around a fraction too long. And then… BAM! Everything went black.

"Am I dead or alive?" I thought, but then I heard a voice I recognized. The dog, 
a mutt who smelled like a rotting blanket, said, "Hey cat, hang on. Don't eat 
that mouse just yet." "But I haven’t had a decent meal in days," whined the 
cat. "Neither have I, but the mouse will only satisfy your tummy for a few 
hours. We can use him to fill our stomachs and our masters’ stomachs for the 
rest of our days." "It's a mouse, not a hen. He can’t lay eggs," snarled the cat. 
"No," woofed the dog, "that's not what I mean."

"The first thing about a mouse is that he's small…""So?""So, if we take him to 
the house where the magic ring is, he can slip inside and get it for us. He'll do 
this because his life depends on it. The Magpie told me where the house is. 
Let’s head off!" The cat saw the dog was not as stupid as he looked, so the cat 
held me in his mouth by my tail and sprang through the window. Off they ran 
down the alleyway. I was jostled around, but hey, I was still alive.

Luckily, we were not far from the ring’s location. Inside we could see a man 
and woman, both well-fed and happy. The dog said, "We've come to the right 
place. Hopefully, she takes the ring off tonight." The cat prowled around, 
finding a tiny hole near a window. "You go in," she said, "and bring back the 
ring if you value your pathetic mousey life." In I went, and although mice 
aren’t equipped with a nose for gold, I was able to spot the ring glinting in the 
moonlight. The lady left it on the table with her other jewelry.

I seized the ring in my mouth and slipped back out again. "Here it is," I said to 
the cat. "Say goodbye to this cruel world, little mouse," replied the cat, with 
claws flashing in the moonlight. I trembled for my life, but the dog woofed, 
"Stop right there, cat. We must keep our word." We returned to the town. 
This time, the cat went over the rooftops while the dog ran down the 
alleyways. I went home to my nest for a good sleep.

A few weeks later, I was going past the house where the cat and the dog lived. 
I looked through the window. The human couple was having a feast, and the 
cat had put on weight. "So," I thought, "the magic ring truly does prevent 
hunger." I too deserved a reward for my daring part in the rescue of the ring, 
so I decided to slip inside for some crumbs. Around the back of the house, I 
found the dog tied up, more miserable than ever. "What's happened?" I 
asked, "The house is full of food. Why aren't you tucking in?"
	
The dog whined. "Aroooo! That filthy lying cat! She ran to the house before 
me and sprang onto our owners' bed, waking them with the great gift of the 
ring. Oh, how delighted they were! She is rewarded every day, but they 
punish me. They think I'm just a smelly, useless animal. I'm lucky if they 
remember to throw me a scrap. GRRRRRRR! I shall hate that cat until the day 
I die, and so shall all my puppies hate all cats forever!"

The Jenson family had been camping in the Smokey Mountains for the last 
three Spring Breaks in a row. They loved to get away from their busy lives, 
slow down, and enjoy nature and each other. The Jensons had two little boys.
William was their older son at nine years old. He took after his mother, with 
deep brown hair and eyes and olive-toned skin. He took every responsibility 
given to him seriously, just like his mother, and he enjoyed giving advice to 
his younger brother. Zack, a five-year-old, was more like his father with 
strawberry-blonde hair and a pale complexion. He was also more like his 
father in his love for mischief. His father enjoyed hiding around corners and 
popping out at the next passer-by, saying, "Boo!" and startling them. Zack 
also loved to hide and surprise people, but he had other added mischievous 
behaviors, as well.

The Jensons camped in an old RV that Mr. Jenson had to repair during just 
about every trip. Last season, a gasket on the toilet had given out, causing a 
leak the Mr. Jenson spent hours fixing. He’d had to travel to the nearest RV 
specialty store to replace the part. This year, there seemed to be some 
problem with the RV’s electrical system. The Jensons had tried everything 
they could think of, and they couldn’t get the air conditioning to run. Mrs. 
Jenson had decided to walk the campsite, looking for RV campers that 
seemed to have a good deal of experience. Maybe someone had had this 
problem before and knew how to fix it. Mr. Jenson stayed at the RV, trying 
different fuses, checking plugs and connections, and generally tinkering with 
anything he thought might relate to the problem. He looked up to check on 
the boys every time he thought about it.

William and Zack were playing Adventure Seekers, which was basically hide 
and seek while wearing safari hats and supply backpacks. Their parents' rule 
was that they could not leave their particular campsite without permission.
That gave them the thirty yards between their camper and the next. There 
weren't many hiding places in this small space. On Zack's turn to hide, his 
brother covered his eyes and counted to twenty, while Zack tiptoed out of 
the campsite and into the woods across the street. He watched from behind 
some bushes as his big brother searched everywhere in the campsite. Zack 
couldn't help but giggle that he'd outsmarted William, but as soon as he 
heard that laugh, William's head whipped around, following the giggle to 
Zack's spot in the bushes. William started to run toward his little brother, 
yelling that it was breaking the rules to be out of the campsite.

William looked around for his dad, but didn’t see him. He must've been inside 
the RV working on the problem. So, William ran to get Zack and bring him 
back to the campsite himself. Zack saw his brother running toward him, but 
he laughed even harder and ran off in the opposite direction. He heard 
William calling, "No! Stop! We can't leave the campsite. We're going to get 
in trouble!", Zack wouldn't stop, though. He wouldn't give up and lose the 
game that easily. William finally caught up to Zack when his little brother 
tripped over a tree root. Angry that his little brother was about to get him in 
huge trouble, he yanked Zack up by the arm. "What are you thinking, you 
little idiot?" Zack had a skinned knee from the fall, so his brother's yelling 
made him cry with pitiful little sobs. William sighed and hugged Zack. "I can't 
stay mad at you when you cry. No fair."

When Zack's fit ended, William said, "Let's try to retrace our steps and get 
back to the campsite. Maybe, if we hurry, we'll get back before dad notices 
we're gone." The boys walked back in the direction they thought they came 
from, but they didn't find the campsite. They walked and walked, but 
everything looked the same. William had been so busy watching where Zack 
was running on their way out into the woods that he really had no idea what 
any landmarks might be. He had no idea if they were headed in the right 
direction or the wrong direction. They couldn't see or hear any other 
campers, and it was starting to get dark. William thought back to the lessons 
his parents had taught him about camping. The most important thing they 
needed was water. After that, they'd need shelter and food. William had Zack 
stop and sit down so they could take inventory of the supplies in their 
backpacks.

Back at the campsite, Mr. Jenson had realized his boys were missing a few 
minutes after they disappeared into the woods. He began calling their 
names, trying to get them to come out of hiding. When this didn't work, he 
tried searching around the campsite, but he couldn't find any sign of them. 
Beginning to panic, he called his wife and together they called the park 
rangers. Soon, every available person in the campground was getting 
organized in a search pattern beginning at the Jenson's campsite. Both 
Jensons were determined to help in the search, although they struggled to 
control their panic enough to listen to directions. Soon, the woods were filled 
with the voices of rangers and volunteer searchers calling, "William? Zack?"
After a few hours with no sign of the boys, the rangers called in their "secret 
weapon." An hour later, a man named Chuck arrived with a droopy, drooling, 
red-eyed old bloodhound. "This here's Rufus," Chuck told the Jensons. "He

may look a mess, but he can track a scent for miles. Just get me something 
that smells like your boys."
Mrs. Jenson ran to the camper and returned with the stuffed animal Zack 
cuddled in his sleep and the blanket that William slept with. "That'll be 
perfect," said Chuck, holding the items out to Rufus. "Rufus - Find!" In their 
backpacks, William and Zack both had an almost full water bottle, two 
granola bars, and a few packets of snack crackers. Zack had a small flashlight 
in his bag, and William had a book he'd been reading. As night fell, instead of
looking for the campsite, William began looking for shelter. He told his little 
brother what to look for, as well. They found a place where a tree with a huge 
trunk had fallen and become embedded into a hill. The trunk and hillside 
formed something like a cave. The boys cleared the ground and snuggled 
back into the cave for the night. William explained to Zack that they 
shouldn't eat all their food and drink all their water. They should ration these 
items in case it took more than one night for their parents to find them.

"Do you think it'll take very long," Zack asked. He had run out of mischief, and 
all he felt now was fear. "Of course not," said William. "I just want to be 
careful just in case. I know mom and dad started looking for us as soon as you 
ran off. They'll probably be here before morning." "It's gonna get really dark, 
isn't it?" "Maybe. But it'll be okay. We'll see all the stars. And we have your 
flashlight." William put his arm around his little brother. He felt scared, too, 
but he knew that he had to act brave or Zack would get even more afraid. "I'm 
really tired, but I don't think I can sleep," said Zack. "How about I read to 
you?" William asked. "I don't like books with no pictures." "I know. That's why 
it might help you sleep." "Oh. Okay."

William read to his little brother by the tiny bright circle from the flashlight.
Soon enough, his eyelids began to droop, and Zack was fast asleep with his 
head on William's shoulder. William kept watch as best he could, turning the 
flashlight toward any small sound that frightened him in the forest. He saw 
bugs, rodents, and one fat raccoon. Eventually, even as on-edge as he felt, 
William couldn't stay awake any longer. The next thing the boys knew, they 
were awakened by a howl. William jumped up and stood in front of his little 
brother, but it was a howl of recognition from Rufus the bloodhound. The dog 
had tracked the boys, bringing Chuck and the Jensons with him.

After the tears of relief and hugs of joy, the rescuers asked the boys how they 
had made it through the night on their own. William explained how he knew 
to ration the food and find shelter. He told them how he kept Zack calm by

reading. All the adults were impressed with his bravery and intelligence. The 
Jensons were happy just to be back together again. Still, they got invitations 
to be on the news and tell the boys' survival tale. Many people recognized 
William for the way he kept calm and protected his little brother. The ordeal 
made Zack pay more attention to the rules, at least most of the time.
